```

A total of _N_ = `r nstudy+ndrop` participants were interviewed in an online questionnaire by _respondi_ in April 2022 in Germany. 

-text here-

We had to exclude _n_ = `r ndrop` participants due to straightlining (identical answers on 15 consecutive items) and an overal lack of answer variation (within-person _sd_ < 0.50).

The cleaned and final data for the present study had _N_ = `r nstudy` participants (age: *M* = `r age.m`, *SD* = `r age.sd`; Min = `r age.min`, Max = `r age.max`). Of these there were `r p.fem`% women, `r p.emp`% employed, and `r p.educ`% had finished at least ten classes in the local education system (i.e., *Mittlerer Schulabschluss*) (also see the Appendix).

## Associations With Values and Domain-Specific Beliefs




### Role of values

```{r p12, fig.cap="Awareness of and holding behavior of digital- and/or cryptocurrencies",fig.subcap=c("Awareness","Holding behavior now or in the past"),fig.asp=1,fig.ncol=2,out.width=".49\\linewidth",fig.pos="H"}
# p1
df_long %>% plot_values("krybws01")
# p2
df_long %>% 
  filter(krybws01 == "Has heard")%>% 
  plot_values("krybst01")
```

```{r p34, fig.cap="Intention to hold digital- and/or cryptocurrencies in the future", fig.subcap=c("Has heard and previously held","Has heard but never held"),fig.asp=1,fig.ncol=2,out.width=".49\\linewidth",fig.pos="H"}
# p3
df_long %>% 
  filter(krybws01 == "Has heard")%>% 
plot_values("krybsz01")
# p4
df_long %>% 
  filter(krybws01 == "Has heard",
         krybst01 == "Never held")%>% 
plot_values("krybsz01")
```

Figures \@ref(fig:p12) and \@ref(fig:p34) depict density distributions of value preferences. Value preferences are not making a difference between people in view of whether they have heard of cryptocurrencies or not. Nonetheless, values of self-transcendence are generally highly preferred both among people who have heard and haven't heard of cryptocurrencies, whereas values of self-enhancement are generally less preferred in both groups. We also note that density plots for self-enhancement and self-transcendence are different both in shape and central tendency (median displayed) between people who currently hold, previously held, or never held cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, values of self-enhancement and of self-transcendence are most visibly divergent between people who want to hold, do not want to hold, or are unsure about holding cryptocurrencies in the future. The fact that the density plots of these values are most visibly diverging suggests a robust finding, namely that the content incompatibility between the two had an effect on people's decision to, at some point in the past or future, acquire such assets as cryptocurrencies.

The following section is dedicated to exploring associations between value preferences and behavior and intention in view of cryptocurrencies, while effects due to demographics and beliefs associated with cryptocurrencies are accounted for. 

## Logistic regressions

Model fit indices and nested model comparisons for estimated logistic regression models are summarized in the Appendix. We note that the inclusion in model 4 of interaction terms between value preferences and beliefs about cryptocurrencies did not lead to an improvement in model fit over the estimated terms in model 3. That is, the interaction terms did not contribute to explaining either the cryptocurrency behavior nor the intention to hold cryptocurrencies. Thus, in the following paragraphs we focus on reporting main effects in models 1 to 3 and return to the finding concerning interaction terms in Discussion.

```{r}

sen_m3_p=res_hyp_cryptonow[6,13] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)

och_m3b_p=res_hyp_cryptofutr[5,13] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)

och_m2b_b=res_hyp_cryptofutr[5,6] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)
och_m2b_p=res_hyp_cryptofutr[5,9] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)

# beliefs
exch_m3_b=res_hyp_cryptonow[8,10] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)
exch_m3_p=res_hyp_cryptonow[8,13] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)
good_m3_b=res_hyp_cryptonow[11,10] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)
good_m3_p=res_hyp_cryptonow[11,13] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)

good_m3b_b=res_hyp_cryptofutr[11,10] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)
good_m3b_p=res_hyp_cryptofutr[11,13] %>%  as.numeric() %>% round(2)
```

Table 2 summarizes results of logistic regressions with cryptocurrency holding behavior as the outcome variable. The fullest model had the main effect of self-enhancement values as statistically significant and in the predicted direction (_b_ = `r sen_m3_b`, _p_ = `r sen_m3_p`), whereas the main effect of openness to change values was not significant (_b_ = `r och_m3_b`, _p_ = `r och_m3_p`). Furthermore, two of the five beliefs associated with cryptocurrencies had likewise a main effect that was statistically significant, namely a belief regarding the monetary exchange potential (_b_ = `r exch_m3_b`, _p_ = `r exch_m3_p`) and a belief that it was a good time to buy cryptocurrencies (_b_ = `r good_m3_b`, _p_ = `r good_m3_p`).

Table 3 summarizes results of logistic regressions with intention to hold cryptocurrencies as the outcome variable. The fullest model had the main effect of openness to change values significant and in the predicted direction (_b_ = `r och_m3b_b`, _p_ = `r och_m3b_p`), whereas the main effect of self-enhancement values was not significant (_b_ = `r sen_m3b_b`, _p_ = `r sen_m3b_p`). The main effect of self-enhancement values however was significant in model 2, where the effects of beliefs were not included (_b_ = `r och_m2b_b`, _p_ = `r och_m2b_p`). Moreover, there was a significant main effect of the belief that it was a good time to buy cryptocurrencies (_b_ = `r good_m3b_b`, _p_ = `r good_m3b_p`).

# Discussion

Our sample was not representative to the German general population, but it used strict quotas of gender, age and education. Please note that our intention was to gain first insights into an overall pattern regarding adoption of cryptocurrencies in society.
